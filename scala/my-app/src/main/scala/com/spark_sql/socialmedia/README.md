<h1 align="center"> Apache Avro </h1> <br>

## About
From the official site: "Apache Avro is a data serialization system"
Avro is a row-oriented RPC and data serialization framework developed within Apache's Hadoop project.
It uses JSON for defining data types and protocols, and serializes data in a compact binary format.

## Benefit
- Rich data structures.
- A compact, fast, binary data format.
- A container file, to store persistent data.
- Remote procedure call (RPC).
- Simple integration with dynamic languages.
- Code generation is not required to read or write data files nor to use or implement RPC protocols.
- Code generation as an optional optimization, only worth implementing for statically typed languages.
